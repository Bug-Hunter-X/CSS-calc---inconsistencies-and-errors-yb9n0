The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be errors if you try to use it with units inconsistently or if the calculation results in an invalid value. For example, using `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is valid, but `width: calc(100% - 10em);` might not work as expected. Another issue is that `calc()` can't handle units like `pt` or `pc` consistently across browsers.
